PREF
====

PREF (Portable Reverse Engineering Framework) aims to be the swiss army knife for Reverse Engineering.
The basic idea is to have an all in one software for binary and file format analysis and disassembling 
for every platform that runs Qt and Lua.

Software's Structure
-----
PREF provides at the moment:
- Scriptable SDK (dedicated repository: https://github.com/Dax89/PrefSDK)
- Scriptable Format Parser with custom User Interface support (You can build your UI in QML for you format!)
- Scriptable Disassembler Engine.
- Signature Scanner.
- Visual Rapprentation of the binary file (currently using Binary View, and Dot Plot).
- String Scanner.
- Histogram View and Entropy Calculation.
- Binary Colored Visualization (Byte class or Entropic view) of the visible part of the file.
